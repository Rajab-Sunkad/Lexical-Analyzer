# Lexical-Analyzer
Lexical Analyzer is the first phase of a compiler that converts a stream of characters from a source program into a sequence of tokens.   This project implements a simple lexical analyzer in C, which scans a .c  file and classifies tokens such as keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, and symbols.
